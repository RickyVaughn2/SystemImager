#Â   A list of binaries to be copied in for the auto-install client 
#   initrd template from the build-host.
#
#   - All binaries will be found according to where they live in $PATH
#   - If a binary isn't found, a warning will be shown, but you will be
#     allowed to continue.  For example, this means you don't have to 
#     install binaries for filesystems you do not use.
